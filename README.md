##Project's Description

In this project we are going to start the first phase towards creating a web application of an AirBnB which is 'The console'. The console is a command interpreter to handle objects. This is a very important instance because we are using everything that we learnt about python to create a website. We also learnt how to serialize (converting python objects to json string representation) and deserialize (converting the json representation to objects), whic are two important processes to work with nowadays.

##The Console: Commands

| Command | Function |
| ------ | ------ |
| quit | exits the program |
| create | creates a new instance, saves it and prints the id|
| show | prints the string representation of an instance based on the classname and id |
| destroy | deletes an instance based on the class name and id  |
| all | prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name|
| update | updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute |
